## Summary ##
This application intercepts all outgoing calls, routes them through the internet to the Google Voice service, and initiates the call so that Google Voice calls you back to connect the phone call. The program allows you to set the number for Google Voice to call back.

The program is based on Evan Charlton's program, GV, which can be found at http://evancharlton.com/projects/gv/. The program, GV, is protected under the Apache License 2.0.

This program DOES NOT include any of the SMS checking, Voicemail checking, unnecessary alert/notifications, and uses minimal memory while open. I am not including SMS or Voicemail checking because the Google Voice application already includes this functionality.
